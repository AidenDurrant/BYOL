# Unofficial Pytorch Lightning Implementation of BYOL

Unofficial Pytorch Lightning implemnentation of [BYOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733): "Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised Learning"

In addition to the weight standardization and group norm presented in [BYOL works even without batch statistics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10241.pdf)

Updated README.md with results and instructions to follow shortly.
